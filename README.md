# CS4171_Compiler_Design - IIESTS

Welcome to my personal CS4171-Compiler-Design laboratory repository for IIESTS (Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur). This repository is a collection of all the code and projects I have developed during the CS4171 course. It serves as a personal workspace where I can keep track of my progress and store all the work I have done throughout the semester.

## About the Course

CS4171 Compiler Design is a fascinating laboratory course that complements the CS4101 Compiler Design theory course. Through this hands-on experience, I have gained practical insights into designing and implementing compilers. The labs covered various stages of the compiler construction process, from lexical analysis to code generation. It was an excellent opportunity to learn and apply the principles and techniques of compiler design in real-world scenarios.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into different directories, each corresponding to a specific lab or project. This structure allows me to easily navigate and locate the relevant code for each component of the compiler. Here's a brief overview of the main directories:

1. **Lab1_Lexical_Analyzer**: Contains the code for the first lab, where I implemented a lexical analyzer to tokenize the input source code.



## My Approach

Throughout this course, I have approached each lab with a focus on understanding the underlying concepts and implementing them from scratch. I have taken the opportunity to experiment with different algorithms and data structures to optimize the performance of my compiler components. Additionally, I have strived to maintain clean and well-documented code to make it easier to revisit and build upon in the future.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the course instructors for guiding me throughout this journey and providing valuable feedback on my work. This course has been a challenging but rewarding experience, and I am grateful for the knowledge and skills I have gained in the field of compiler design.

## Note to Visitors

Please note that this repository contains my personal work and serves as a reference for my progress in the CS4171-Compiler-Design laboratory course. Feel free to explore the code, but please refrain from using it as a direct solution for your own assignments. If you find any interesting ideas or improvements, I'd be happy to discuss them and share my insights.

Happy coding!
